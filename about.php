                    <p class="text-justify"> The introduction guides your reader into the paper by introducing the topic. It should
            begin with a hook that catches the reader’s interest. This hook could be a quote, an
            analogy, a question, etc. After getting the reader’s attention, the introduction should
            give some background information on the topic. The ideas within the introduction
            should be general enough for the reader to understand the main claim and gradually
            become more specific to lead into the thesis statement. (See the Introductions
            handout for further information.)
            Thesis Statement
            The thesis statement concisely states the main idea or argument of the essay, sets
            limits on the topic, and can indicate the organization of the essay. The thesis works as
            a road map for the entire essay, showing the readers what you have to say and which
            main points you will use to support your ideas. (See the Thesis Statements handout.)
            Body
            The body of the essay supports the main points presented in the thesis. Each point is
            developed by one or more paragraphs and supported with specific details. These
            details can include support from research and experiences, depending on the
            assignment. In addition to this support, the author’s own analysis and discussion of the topic ties ideas
            together and draws conclusions that support the thesis. Refer to “Parts of a Paragraph” below for
            further information on writing effective body paragraphs.
            Transitions Transitions connect paragraphs to each other and to the thesis. They are used within and between
            paragraphs to help the paper flow from one topic to the next. These transitions can be one or two words
            (“first,” “next,” “in addition,” etc.) or one or two sentences that bring the reader to the next main point.
            The topic sentence of a paragraph often serves as a transition. (See the Transitions handout for further
            information.)
